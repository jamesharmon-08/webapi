# webapi

Day95 of 100DaysOfCode Today I was challenged to build a custom website using an API that you find interesting.

I used the-one-api to get a list of quotes from Lord of the Rings books and put a random quote in index.html.  
This project included imports from flask, requests and random.

If I am to return to this project I will add a function to pick another quote without having to make another request to
the-one-api.dev
